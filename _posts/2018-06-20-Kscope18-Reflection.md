Kscope is a whirlwind adventure. I have been very luck to be able to attend Kscope 3 years in a row.

Here is a recap of my week!

## Welcome Reception

I was a bit late coming in on Sunday and sadly missed the informative Sunday Symposium. However, I did arrive in time to attend the fun Welcome Reception where we were encouraged to dress as our favorite character.

## Sessions

I attended numerous sessions throughout the week, including but not limited to [Mark Rittman](), [Francesco Tissiott](), [Jerome Francoise](), [Stewart Bryson](), [Gabby Rubin and Matt Milela](), [Hookmax](). On Wednesday, I was invited to be on a [panel.]() We had a fantastic conversation with great audience participation.

## AceDinner

I was honored to join a fantastic group of people for dinner. There I was awarded Oracle Ace Associate, along side many others very deserving individuals.

## 5K

Got up early to participate in the 5K. I had great company and the sunrise was legendary!

## Catching up with Friends

I've made some wonder friends at Kscope over the last few years. Several of them were here again this year and it is always a great pleasure to see everyone again!

## Representing US-Analytics

This year I was able to help out in our Vendor Booth which was a blast. I enjoyed being able to talk shop with people as they stopped by during breaks. We had the best shirts at the conference as well!

## Special Event

The special event this year was fantastic. Driving racing go-karts, daring the heights on the rope course, and of course rocking the bright colors!
