## The Lineup

I had a great time on Thursday during the morning Deep Dive session. Our Analytics track was doing a Visualization Showcase. [Mike Jelen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikejelen/) was our MC. We had on the panel [Andy Tauro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewptauro/), [Teal Sexton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teal-sexton-3a7a2639/), [Tim Vlamis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timvlamis/), [Myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/becky-wagner-bb356924/), [Neviana Zhgaba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nevianazhgaba/), and [Gary Adashek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garymichaeladashek/).

## Andy digs into flavor

I learned a lot during Andy's session about DV and Explain, as well as flavor profiles. He was a great sport about going adhoc to demo the Explain feature at [Mike Durran's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikedurran/) direction and guidance.

## Teal does D3 beautifully

Teal showed what can be done with a good plan, and great visuals. The Berkeley page is fantastically interactive and answers business questions in a very visually appealing way.

## Tim teaches timely differentiation

Tim is a natural teacher. In 10 minutes he was able to show the best and quickest way to take normal data and make the most meaningful visual representations from it. I actually had a data set from our vendor booth that I used and followed along Tim's steps in real time.

## I take it technical

I first showed the data set I just used from Tim's talk to the croud. Thank you Tim for the great instructions.

Then I cover what my colleague and I have been working on over the last few weeks. We have pulled in files and have a full audit by person or by subject area for all security permissions. The details can be found on the slides [here](https://www.slideshare.net/RebeccaWagner1/kscope19-deep-dive-visualization-showcase).

## Neviana does #data4good

Neviana has been doing some amazing things this year with #data4good, and [FABE (For All a Beautiful Earth)](https://twitter.com/fabedlh). She shows how her visualizations make the most impact by being similar to the devastating image used beside it. These datasets are now available on the public Oracle Analytics Cloud [sandbox](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/OACsandbox/oacsandbox.html) as well!

## Gary recaps and shows us elbows

Last but not least, Gary did a great recap and then showed us to build our own custom visualization [plugins](https://www.oracle.com/solutions/business-analytics/data-visualization/extensions.html), as well as highlighting the library where Oracle and the public can share their own plugins as well. Gary's built a few plugins, the [Butterfly Chart](https://www.oracle.com/solutions/business-analytics/data-visualization/extensions.html), the [Vertical Waterfall](https://www.oracle.com/solutions/business-analytics/data-visualization/extensions.html), and my favorite ["Elbow" Dendrogram](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JWhOHUMd1jlsiVIvU_yvcJMMRQowgYg5)
