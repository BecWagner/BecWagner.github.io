## Business Travel

This year was the 3rd year I've been a consultant. I travel for work on occassion and I received some advice very early on that has really been valueable to me. I want to share this here as well. Most of the following article is written in generalities based on reimbursable business travel in the US and what offers are available at the time of writing this article.
***Disclaimer: The links I provide are specific to my accounts and will give me a bonus. Feel free to use or not.***

1. Use a separate credit card (or 2) for work travel and expenses.
2. Pick a brand and loyalty/rewards program and use it as often as possible.

## Credit Cards and Loyalty Programs

There are many credit cards you can sign up for. Some are brand specific and some are generic travel credit cards. Often they have a yearly fee (which if you use them even for 1 trip often gives enough rewards that cover the fee). I will share the 3 that I have and my reasoning behind my choices.

## Airlines

My recommendation is to first look at your local airport and figure out which airline has most destinations. This may not always be the right answer if you know you need to travel to a certain destination regularly that isn't serviced by an airine, but generally it will work for most cases. For my local airport, there are 3 airlines to choose from, Southwest, United, and Delta. In most airports in the US, this will hold true. Choose the airline you are likely to use the most, and go investigate the credit cards that are specific to that airline. Many times, there is a sign up bonus of you spend $X then you get a giant heap of points. This is generally the best option at the time. Offers come and go and the number of points and the required $X to spend does fluctuate.

I ended up going with a Chase Southwest Rewards Card and use it for all of my flights. I chose Southwest because they have the best, most direct, and most frequent destinations for Kansas City.

Earn up to 60,000 points with the [Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Credit Card](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/224a/HITXOZ970E). I can be rewarded too, [learn more](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/224a/HITXOZ970E).

Now go pick your loyalty/rewards program and sign up! Be sure to tie that number to your credit card. Once you have your credit card number, go back into your reward program and set it up as your default card for airline purchases. Those double and triple points make a huge difference.

## Hotels

When you travel for work, you'll also likely be staying overnight most of the time. Again pick a brand and stick with it. The two biggest chains are Marriott and Hilton. Very often you will find both within a small radius of any destination. Pick one. I can't tell you which is better, only that I started with a smaller chain and quickly learned I needed to switch to one of these two.

I have the Chase Marriott Rewards Card and use it for all of my hotels. I switched to Marriott when I realized the brand I was using wasn't as common and I was struggling to find hotels close to my clients.

Earn 2 Free Night Awards with the [Marriott Rewards Premier Plus Credit Card](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/252/KFGXKT30EB). I can be rewarded too, [learn more](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/252/KFGXKT30EB).

Now go pick your loyalty/rewards program and sign up! Be sure to tie that number to your credit card. Once you have your credit card number, go back into your reward program and set it up as your default card for hotel purchases. Those double and triple points make a huge difference.

## For the other use cases

Maybe you don't get to choose a single brand, or book your own flights and hotels. If you don't have a company provided card, then I recommend a general points card that plays nicest with whichever loyalty program you are using most often.

I have a Chase Sapphire Preferred card and it is my catch all of travel expenses that don't get double/triple points on the other cards. I chose this one because it transferred 1-1 or better for all of my loyalty programs. Do a bit of reading to see if this is a good fit for you.

Earn 50,000 bonus points with [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/0RF85NOE1T). I can be rewarded too, [learn more](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/0RF85NOE1T).

## Travel gear

If you are traveling for the week or less, I highly recommend getting a carry-on suitcase and a very comfortable laptop bag. I'm still using the same [carry-on](https://amzn.to/2BVvqQX) that I bought in January 2015. The hunt for the right laptop bag has been an ongoing trial for me. It is a very personal thing and what works for one person (big, has built in chargers, all the pockets) doesn't work for another (lightweight, minimal, sits higher on the back). I've gone through 5 laptop backpacks and I'm still not 100% happy, but have this [Belkin slim one](https://amzn.to/2s2C2Zj).

## Sit back and enjoy!

I believe rewards points matter almost not at all for the regular person who doesn't travel often. For those of us that do, whether for work or pleasure, it is really pretty easy to get higher loyalty status and bonus points without much effort as long as you stick to a brand. Both my airline and hotel cards have given me enough points to completely cover airfare and hotel for my family of 5 to Disney 2 times, and a weeklong trip to Scotland. Your mileage may vary, but I bet you find yourself with more points than you know what to do with within a year.
