## Sessions all the way down

Tuesday at 8:50am I had my session on ***Active Directory and Single Sign-on for Oracle Analytics Cloud***. It was a great engaged audience where I had many questions. This is a session I've done a couple times now, and I really enjoy getting into the technical nitty gritty. You can see my deck from OOW18 below:

## Oracle Analytics Summit

## Vendor Session

My company [US-Analytics](www.us-analytics.com) was the ODTUG Analytics Track sponsor this year at Kscope19. After the livestream completed, I delivered a Vendor session on one of our products [UnifyBI](https://www.us-analytics.com/unifybi) that allows you to connect and report on OBIEE/OAC from the front end of Tableau or Power BI.

## Lunch and Learn Panel

Panels are always such a great time to be a part of and I was happy to be asked to join some fellow [Oracle ACE and ACE Directors](https://kscope19.odtug.com/page/lunch-and-learn) on Tuesday for the Lunch and Learn Panel covering Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, and Analytics. [Stewart Bryson](https://twitter.com/stewartbryson) moderated the panel and we had great discussions and questions from the audience.

## Oracle ACE dinner

To round out the busiest day of my week, there was the Oracle ACE program dinner. Thank you for the fun conversations, learning about JET, and of course the amazing food!
