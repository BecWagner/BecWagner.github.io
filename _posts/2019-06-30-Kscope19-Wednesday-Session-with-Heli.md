## Kscope19 Session: Turbocharging your Data Engineering Career

One of the great parts of the ODTUG Leadership program is that you get to hear from industry experts on numerous topics. Many of them made a great impact on me and because of that, I wanted to propose a slightly different kind of session this year. I asked [Heli Helskyaho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helihelskyaho/) if she would do a Career session with me. (A whole other post on the Leadership program is probably coming soon, stay tuned!)

I am very glad I got to do a session with Heli. It went very well in my opinion. Our slides are can be found in the [ODTUG site](https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&s=2568&print=1&req=info) and also here on my [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/RebeccaWagner1/kscope19-turbocharging-your-career).

## Overcoming Negativity

While at Kscope19 this week, I did get a very short chance to say 'Hi' and chat for a few seconds with [Jeff Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thatjeffsmith/). (There is never enough time to catch up with everyone.) He shared an anecdote with me that was very special and it rang true with me and I used it in my session with Heli.

There is a section from Heli in our session on avoiding negativity. Jeff spends a great deal of time on forums and helping Oracle customers. Being on the internet a lot, he does encounter a larger than usual share of the trolls and negative people. He mentioned to me that anytime he needs an antidote to the negativity, he just pulls my note I sent him after the presentation he gave my Leadership Program class. Now keep in mind, I don't really remember sending him a note, but that doesn't really matter. He made an impact on me during my leadership program. I sent him a note to let him know. It took me probably a few minutes to share my appreciation with him. That small bit of thanks is enough to keep the negativity at bay.

Think about that. And now go to the person who has helped you, listened to you, shared some advice with you. Tell them thanks. It can make a whole world of difference for a person for years.
