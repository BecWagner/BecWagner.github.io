## Backstory

A few years ago, shortly after I started working at Rittman Mead, [Michael Rainey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainey/) was encouraging me to look into pursuing [Oracle ACE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oracle-ace/index.html) and [ODTUG Leadership Program](https://www.odtug.com/page/leadership). I applied and got accepted to the ODTUG Leadership Program in 2015, and was in the class of 2016.

One of the great parts of the ODTUG Leadership program is that you get to hear from industry experts on numerous topics. Many of them made a great impact on me and because of that, I wanted to propose a slightly different kind of session this year. I asked [Heli Helskyaho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helihelskyaho/) if she would do a Career session with me.

## Overcoming Negativity

Heli's presentation to my Leadership Program class a couple of years ago was about balance and having more than 24 hours in a day. It resonated a lot with me and made me rethink all of the excuses I was making. She hadn't realized she made an impact on me until I shared it during our Kscope19 session this last week.

Another presentation during my Leadership Program that really helped me was [Jeff Smith's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thatjeffsmith/) talk about creating a social media presence. This was super helpful as I had not really done social media before.

While at Kscope19 this week, I did get a very short chance to say 'Hi' and chat for a few seconds with Jeff. (There is never enough time to catch up with everyone.) He shared an anecdote with me that was very special and it rang true with me and I used it in my session with Heli.

There is a section from Heli in our session on avoiding negativity. Jeff spends a great deal of time on forums and helping Oracle customers. Being on the internet a lot, he does encounter a larger than usual share of the trolls and negative people. He mentioned to me that anytime he needs an antidote to the negativity, he just pulls my note I sent him after the presentation he gave my Leadership Program class. Now keep in mind, I don't really remember sending him a note, but that doesn't really matter. He made an impact on me during my leadership program. I sent him a note to let him know. It took me probably a few minutes to share my appreciation with him. That small bit of thanks is enough to keep the negativity at bay.

Think about that. And now go to the person who has helped you, listened to you, shared some advice with you. Tell them thanks. It can make a whole world of difference for a person for years.

## ODTUG Leadership Program and Oracle ACE

I've spoken now at length about how the ODTUG Leadership Program impacted me in this post, but it started my path to Oracle ACE as well. The ODTUG Leadership Program gives the class an opportunity to attend Kscope the following summer. Kscope16 in Chicago was my first conference I'd ever attended, thanks to the leadership program and it was quite frankly overwhelming. Some amazing people from around the world took me under their wing and helped me navigate and feel included. [Christian Berg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bergch/), [Gianni Ceresa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gceresa/), [Pete Nitschke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-nitschke/), [Sarah Craynon Zumbrum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sczumbrum/), and many others. Soon after the conference, I joined a community of likeminded nerds in the Telegram/IRC channel #obihackers where many experts in the field hang out. This led to Christian Berg nominating me to the Oracle ACE program, and helping me submit for my first ever talk/presentation at UKOUG in 2017, where I won the 'Best New Overseas Speaker' award.

Since then, I've become an Oracle ACE Associate, and now recently promoted to an Oracle ACE. I was also able to attend and present at Oracle Open World 2018 which is amazing and something I never imagined myself doing.

## That was fast!

(I may be stealing a thing from a Michael Rainey post.... shhhhh, don't tell).

I've had an amazing several years and it has gone so fast. I've been the ODTUG Analytics Community Lead for a couple of years now, helping the volunteer community organize meetups, newsletters, webinars, and of course the Kscope Monday Community Night Trivia Party each year. I've also been a part of the abstract selection committee for the last 3 years and this year helped as a Track Content Lead.

Kscope19 has been amazing and I got recognition for these activities. I've been awarded 'ODTUG Volunteer of the Year' and promoted to Oracle ACE. None of this wouldn't have happened without some nudging and encouragement from so many people along the way like Michael Rainey and Christain Berg along the way.

## Well that was a bit meandering

To summarize, be sure to stretch yourself. Don't forget to tell those around you thank you. Ignore the negative comments. Be nice to others (even the negative ones). It might be an extra moment for you, but it can impact others in ways you cannot imagine.

And since I'm meandering, I'll leave you here with a poem from my daughter that is fitting.

## Boundless by Victoria Wagner

<p align="center">
Life is curious.
It is finite, logical, knowable.
Yet somehow it has formed such vast diversity
And through that diversity makes itself boundless.
One life, one person alond can do nothing.
But they are never alone.
When they act, they touch others' lives in way
More complex and more moving than can ever be anticipated.
So it happens that a single life with a dream, an idea,
Can create a wildfire to transform the nature of life entirely.

One person's life is small.
We have a limited time to influence the world around us.
We must make choices that shape our lives and others' lives,
And lay the groundwork for the future, every day.
Many choices are small, by themselves of little consequence.
But our lives are a result of the tiny choices we make.
So we live, and so we will die.
What we leave behind is but memory
And the imprint of our touch on another person's life.
Our touch has the potential to change the way
They choose to live their live,
And so the way they touch other lives, and so on,
Forever, like ripples in a pond.

With such a small time given to us,
We get caught up in the short-term, and the present.
We don't often think about the ripples we create,
Or how they might be waves to others,
Threatening to consume them,
Or offering to carry them to the shore.
The ripples, though faded, always remain
Even as the creator fades away entirely.
We don't think about this.
And so when we see other lives around us,
Growing, smiling, weeping, living,
We often do nothing, or make the wrong choice.
So our ripples are stained by the wounds we make,
Without realizing the pain we cause.
But when we touch a heart with kindness,
The water is purified for all.
If we all open our eyes
To the pain we can prevent,
We can be boundless.
